        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I am Erdem Aslan. Since a young age, my interest in technology has guided me towards the world of software. 
        From the age of 8, I started working in the marketplace and gained experience in different jobs.</p>
        <p>By working in different positions in a factory, I gained experience in work discipline and teamwork. 
        Later, through the Work and Travel program, I had the opportunity to work in various sectors in the USA and gain experience in a global business environment.</p>
        <p>Currently, as a computer engineering student, I continue to improve myself in software development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.</p>
